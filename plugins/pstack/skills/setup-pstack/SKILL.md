# Setup pstack

Configure one portable model sheet for the current parent harness. Read [`provider-dispatch.md`](../poteto-mode/references/provider-dispatch.md) before probing or writing anything. Its model matrices (stock and flex), descriptor grammar, and route table are the contract. Choose one requested effort per assigned matrix family. Do not add a second configuration file, a runtime resolver, or a weaker-model fallback.

Claude Code writes `~/.claude/pstack-models.md` and loads it from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` with:

```text
@~/.claude/pstack-models.md
```

Codex writes `~/.codex/pstack-models.md`. Codex has no `@` include, so mirror the sheet's exact bytes inside one bounded block in `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` and retain the sheet as the editable source of truth:

```text
<!-- pstack:models:begin -->
<exact contents of ~/.codex/pstack-models.md>
<!-- pstack:models:end -->
```

## Steps

### 1. Establish the parent

Use the harness and tool surface running this skill: Claude Code or Codex. Environment markers may corroborate that top-level answer, but do not launch a child and ask it to detect where it came from. Record the parent because the same descriptor takes a different route in each harness.

### 2. Load current state

Read the current parent-specific sheet when it exists. Before matrix validation, normalize only the rolling-alias predecessors that earlier pstack releases generated. A provider-qualified Claude model is migratable when its model component starts with `claude-fable-` or `claude-opus-` and the remaining revision contains only digits and hyphens. Replace that component in memory with `fable` or `opus`, preserving the provider, effort, role, and lane order. Record each original and normalized descriptor for the confirmation in step 7. This migration is valid loaded state and does not require a separate operator choice.

Treat the normalized values as current role-to-family assignments. Overlay those rows on the complete first-run role map in step 7. Materialize any missing documented role row from that map on the next successful write. A duplicate role row is inconsistent state; report it and resolve it before probing. A row whose role is not in the step 7 role map, such as `how critics`, is from a retired role. Drop it and list it at confirmation. A bare host-native slug from an older sheet is also invalid because it does not say which provider owns it. A versioned Claude model outside the two migration families remains inconsistent state. If the sheet is missing, use the complete first-run role map and the model matrix's Default effort cells.

Then ask whether to keep these role-to-family assignments or change named roles. Keeping them is the default. Apply only role changes the operator names; never offer a reset of a customized sheet to the first-run assignments. A changed role may use any stock or flex matrix family, any OpenRouter model ID the operator names (`openrouter:<namespace>/<model>`), `inherit-parent`, or `auto`.

Offer every stock family, including Astra, GPT-6 Sol, and Luna, when changing `architect runners` or another configurable role. Read each model, proposed effort, and selectable efforts from its row. The Codex families are separate families even though they share the Codex provider; changing one family's effort does not change another's. GPT-6 Sol uses the `sol-6` family; the `sol` family keeps GPT-5.6 Sol for sheets that still assign it.

### 3. Parse per-family efforts

Read the model matrices, stock and flex. Every non-alias value must match `<provider>:<model>@<effort>`. Map it to exactly one matrix family by `(provider, model)`; an `openrouter` descriptor maps to the open `openrouter` row whatever its model ID. Require its effort to appear in that row's Selectable efforts cell, and collect the effort. `inherit-parent` and `auto` rows carry no family effort.

An unmatched provider/model, out-of-domain effort, or duplicate role is inconsistent state. Stop, show the conflicting rows verbatim, and ask for an explicit matrix family or alias replacement. If one or more families have mixed efforts, show every conflicting family and role row, then ask for one normalized effort per family from its Selectable efforts cell. Do not invent a precedence rule. Do not probe or write while any inconsistency is unresolved.

A family is a single `(provider, model)` matrix row. DeepSeek Flash and Pro have independent efforts, as do MiniMax M3 and M3.1 Flash Preview. Each distinct OpenRouter model ID is its own family under the open row, with its own effort and probe. Never group efforts or deduplicate probes by provider alone.

One distinct effort per family is the current value. A family with no non-alias occurrence is unassigned: do not ask for its effort, check its CLI, or probe it. A family that a step 2 role change newly assigns takes its matrix Default effort as the proposed value.

### 4. Collect one requested effort per family

Ask one effort question for each assigned family. Name each model, its current or proposed value, and the Selectable efforts from its matrix row. Empty input keeps that value. On a first run, state the assigned families' matrix defaults before asking. On a rerun, state the parsed values without offering to reset customized role lanes.

### 5. Probe the requested pairs

Probe only the selected `provider:model@effort` pair of each assigned family. Run one probe per family in the role map, even when two families share a provider. Do not enumerate or offer older models as substitutes. A failed probe writes nothing: report the failing pair and provider, stop, and keep the active sheet plus parent integration bytes unchanged. A failed model demands explicit repair or role reassignment before saving. A failed first run creates neither artifact.

| Family | Pair source | Claude parent route | Codex parent route | Availability proof |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fable | Fable matrix row + selected effort | native Agent `pstack-fable-<effort>` | Claude CLI | native one-turn probe or `claude auth status --json` plus one-turn probe |
| Sol | Sol matrix row + selected effort | `codex exec` | native `spawn_agent` | `codex login status` plus one-turn probe or native one-turn probe |
| Astra | Astra matrix row + selected effort | external runner | native `spawn_agent` | `codex login status` plus one-turn probe or native one-turn probe |
| GPT-6 Sol | sol-6 matrix row + selected effort | external runner | native `spawn_agent` | `codex login status` plus one-turn probe or native one-turn probe |
| Luna | Luna matrix row + selected effort | external runner | native `spawn_agent` | `codex login status` plus one-turn probe or native one-turn probe |
| Grok | Grok matrix row + selected effort | Grok CLI | Grok CLI | `grok models` must list the requested model; one-turn probe |
| Opus | Opus matrix row + selected effort | native Agent `pstack-opus-<effort>` | Claude CLI | native one-turn probe or `claude auth status --json` plus one-turn probe |
| DeepSeek Flash / Pro | Each assigned DeepSeek flex row + selected effort | external runner | external runner | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` present; isolated config dir free of OAuth credentials; one-turn probe confirms the endpoint |
| MiniMax M3 / M3.1 Flash Preview | Each assigned MiniMax flex row + selected effort | external runner | external runner | `MINIMAX_API_KEY` present; isolated config dir free of OAuth credentials; one-turn probe confirms the endpoint |
| OpenRouter (any model ID) | Each assigned OpenRouter model ID + selected effort | external runner | external runner | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` present; isolated config dir free of OAuth credentials; one-turn probe that reads its marker from a file |

For MiniMax M3.1 Flash Preview, disclose the Token Plan requirement before probing. Use the eligible subscription key through `MINIMAX_API_KEY`; do not assume a working M3 key grants preview access. A failed preview probe must not silently select M3. Keep preview thinking enabled and verify requested effort forwarding; distinguish request evidence from hidden applied reasoning depth.

Before the first OpenRouter probe, tell the operator three things: OpenRouter forwards prompts to whichever host serves the model, data-collection and zero-data-retention routing plus the key's credit limit are set on OpenRouter's dashboard, and each probe spends a little credit. Probe exactly the model ID the operator named. A failed OpenRouter probe does not offer another catalog model; report OpenRouter's error and ask for a replacement ID or a role reassignment.

Use a tiny read-only probe that returns a unique marker. For an OpenRouter model, write the marker to a file in a scratch directory and leave it out of the prompt, so a passing probe proves the model made a tool call; Claude Code lanes cannot work without one. A login-status command alone proves credentials, not that the requested model and effort flags run. Record native and external results separately. Never call the external launcher for the parent's own provider. On a Claude parent, the Fable and Opus probes are one-turn runs of the mapped `pstack-<stem>-<effort>` agent. On a Codex parent, each assigned Codex family gets a native `spawn_agent` probe with its matrix model and selected `reasoning_effort`. Every other pair, flex families always included, uses the external runner with the selected effort flag. A flex probe doubles as the base-URL confirmation: it proves the documented default (or the operator's override) actually serves the lane's model.

Receipts and native transcripts prove the requested effort and the route. They do not prove a provider's hidden applied reasoning depth. There is no implicit timeout, weaker-model fallback, same-provider external fallback, or second mutable configuration source.

### 6. Render, preserving role families

Build the new sheet in memory. Do not write it yet.

- First run: start from the complete role assignments in step 7, with the step 2 role changes applied.
- Rerun: start from the normalized complete role map from step 2, with the step 2 role changes applied, preserving each loaded row's lane order and family (or alias) per lane.

Require every documented role to remain present and non-empty, `architect runners` to keep at least two entries, and the final role map to contain at least one assigned matrix family. There is no requirement to assign every matrix family.

Different models sharing a provider count as one provider, even when their efforts differ. An OpenRouter lane counts as its model ID's lab, as `provider-dispatch.md` defines: the namespaces `anthropic`, `openai`, `x-ai`, `deepseek`, and `minimax` match the direct providers, and any other namespace is a provider of its own.

Validate panel diversity: `arena runners` and `interrogate reviewers` must span at least two distinct providers. A single-provider panel is written only after the operator explicitly confirms the reduced diversity; record that confirmation in the setup report.

Rewrite every matrix-family descriptor to `provider:model@<requested effort for that family>`. Leave `inherit-parent` and `auto` unchanged. An effort-only rerun cannot change a role's family. Changing Grok's effort updates every Grok occurrence and does not move a Sol role onto Grok. Refuse an unqualified slug, an unavailable route, a model outside the stock and flex matrix families, an OpenRouter ID without a namespace or from the `openrouter/*` routers, or a provider/model mismatch.

### 7. Confirm and commit

Show any rolling-alias migrations as original and normalized descriptors and any retired-role rows dropped in step 2. Then show the route table for this parent and every rendered role and descriptor. Ask for confirmation before writing.

Why and Reflect require the parent's live MCP surface. Keep their investigator, reviewer, and synthesizer roles on `inherit-parent` or `auto`; the bounded external runner deliberately omits ambient MCPs. `inherit-parent` and `auto` always validate, but say when they reduce a panel's provider diversity. For panel roles, one lane runs per entry. The list length is the fan-out count. `arena cross-judge pool` is a list from which Arena chooses a provider different from the parent and base candidate when possible. `swarm workers` is the default for every worker unless a race explicitly assigns another descriptor.

Every non-alias value must match `<provider>:<model>@<effort>` and must have passed step 5.

After the operator confirms, write the in-memory render from step 6. Never paste the example below as the result. It is only the complete first-run role map used to seed step 2; selected efforts and explicit role changes always replace its example values before writing.

```markdown
# pstack model configuration

Provider-qualified per-role choices. Read the installed pstack provider-dispatch reference before dispatching a configured role. Every documented role remains present. `inherit-parent` and `auto` use the parent model natively and still count as one panel lane.

### 8. Wire it in

Render the parent integration in memory before either write. On Claude, the integration is the single `@~/.claude/pstack-models.md` include in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. On Codex, it is the exact sheet bytes between one `<!-- pstack:models:begin -->` and `<!-- pstack:models:end -->` pair in `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`. Replace that whole bounded block on a rerun. Insert one block at the end on first run. If either marker is missing, duplicated, or reversed, stop and report inconsistent state instead of guessing a boundary.

Snapshot every target's current bytes. Write the sheet and parent integration only after every requested pair passes and the operator confirms. Read both targets back and compare them with the in-memory render. If either write or readback fails, restore every snapshot and report the failure. An unchanged rerun must produce byte-identical sheet and integration content after normalization.

Do not copy the model sheet between harnesses without rerunning the parent-specific probes; route availability can differ even on the same host.

### 9. Behavioral smoke

Before declaring setup complete, run one small read-only mixed panel from this parent: every distinct chosen descriptor, distinct output/receipt paths, and an independent cross-judge when at least two providers are assigned. Launch Claude-native agents and every external process in the background with retained handles, then drain them. Verify the native transcript entries and every external receipt. A structural config check or unit test is not a substitute.

Report the sheet path, parent route table, requested-effort probe results, smoke results, and external elapsed/token/cost receipts. Re-running this skill re-probes and updates the same sheet. Do not claim the provider exposed hidden applied-effort observability.
