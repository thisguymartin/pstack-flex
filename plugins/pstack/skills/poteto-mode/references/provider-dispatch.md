# Provider dispatch

pstack model choices are provider-qualified descriptors:

```text
<provider>:<model>@<effort>
```

## Model matrix

| Family | Upstream pstack choice | Provider | Model | Default effort | Selectable efforts | Claude-native agent stem |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| fable | fable | claude | fable | max | low medium high xhigh max | fable |
| sol | gpt-5.6-sol-max | codex | gpt-5.6-sol | max | low medium high xhigh max | - |
| grok | grok-4.6-fast-xhigh | grok | grok-4.6 | xhigh | low medium high xhigh max | - |
| opus | opus | claude | opus | xhigh | low medium high xhigh max | opus |
| astra | - | codex | gpt-6-astra | high | low medium high xhigh max | - |
| sol-6 | - | codex | gpt-6-sol | high | low medium high xhigh max | - |
| luna | - | codex | gpt-6-luna | high | low medium high xhigh max | - |

The allowed effort universe is exactly `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`. First-run requested efforts are the Default effort cell of each row. A Claude-native agent stem of `-` means the family has no Claude-native agent. Otherwise the shipped agent name is `pstack-<stem>-<effort>`. `-` in Upstream pstack choice means Cursor's pstack has no default for that family; the row is fork-owned.

`fable` and `opus` are Claude Code's rolling aliases. Claude resolves each alias to the latest available family revision. A runner receipt keeps the requested alias in `model` and the concrete provider-reported revision in `reportedModel`; verification accepts only a numeric `claude-fable-*` or `claude-opus-*` revision from the matching family.

The `astra`, `sol-6`, and `luna` rows are the GPT-6 Codex families (pstack-flex addition). These Codex families use native `spawn_agent` under a Codex parent and the external Codex runner under a Claude Code parent. Each is its own family with its own requested effort and probe; `sol-6` is independent of `sol`, so an existing GPT-5.6 Sol assignment stays unchanged until setup reassigns the role. All Codex families count as one provider for panel diversity.

## Default panel

The first-run panel roles (`arena runners`, `arena cross-judge pool`, `architect runners`, `interrogate reviewers`) use these four lanes, one per entry, at each family's default effort:

`claude:fable@max, codex:gpt-6-astra@high, grok:grok-4.6@xhigh, claude:opus@xhigh`

This line is the single source for the panel default. `setup-pstack`'s first-run sheet and the `arena`, `architect`, and `interrogate` skills copy it verbatim; the static invariant check fails when they drift. Solo code-writing roles (`feature, refactoring`, `bug-fix`, `perf-issue`, `hillclimb`) default to the `sol-6` row; exploration and swarm roles default to the `luna` row.

## Flex model matrix

pstack-flex addition. These lanes are additive. A flex lane runs the stock `claude` binary env-pointed at the provider's Anthropic-compatible endpoint, with the provider's own API key and an isolated `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, so it uses no Anthropic account, no claude.ai login, and no subscription.

| Family | Provider | Model | Default effort | Selectable efforts | API key variable | Base URL default |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| deepseek | deepseek | deepseek-flash | high | low medium high xhigh max | DEEPSEEK_API_KEY | https://api.deepseek.com/anthropic |
| deepseek-pro | deepseek | deepseek-v4-pro | high | low medium high xhigh max | DEEPSEEK_API_KEY | https://api.deepseek.com/anthropic |
| minimax | minimax | MiniMax-M3 | high | low medium high xhigh max | MINIMAX_API_KEY | https://api.minimax.io/anthropic |
| minimax-preview | minimax | MiniMax-M3.1-Flash-Preview | high | low medium high xhigh max | MINIMAX_API_KEY | https://api.minimax.io/anthropic |

A family identifies one `(provider, model)` pair, not an entire provider. The existing `deepseek` and `minimax` family names and descriptors remain valid. `deepseek-pro` and `minimax-preview` are additional choices with independent requested efforts. Multiple models from one provider still count as one provider for panel diversity.

MiniMax preview requires Token Plan access; set `MINIMAX_API_KEY` to the eligible subscription key. A pay-as-you-go key is not proof of preview access. The preview always thinks and supports `low` through `max`; do not disable thinking. M3 thinking is off by default at the API and requires adaptive thinking to enable it; its effort flag does not imply preview-style depth control. Selectable efforts are runner requests, not a claim that every provider applies five distinct reasoning levels. Verify CLI forwarding and model access with live probes.

Flex lanes have no Claude-native agent stem and always take the external runner in both parents. The base URL is a documented default; override it with `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` or `MINIMAX_BASE_URL`, and confirm it against the provider's current Claude Code guide during setup's live probe. The config dir defaults to `~/.pstack-flex/<provider>` (override: `PSTACK_FLEX_<PROVIDER>_CONFIG_DIR`). Secrets stay in the environment: nothing in the sheet, the receipts, or this repository carries a key.

Gateway receipt semantics differ from stock claude lanes in two documented ways. `costUsd` is always `null`: the claude CLI prices `total_cost_usd` at Anthropic rates, which would be fiction for third-party traffic; real prices live in [LANES.md](../../../../../docs/LANES.md), and token usage in the receipt stays accurate. Model verification accepts a case-insensitive matching provider report. A mismatched report fails the lane. When the endpoint reports no model, the receipt uses `modelEvidence: "pinned-argv"` and `modelVerified: false`.

Panel diversity rule (pstack-flex): `arena runners` and `interrogate reviewers` must span at least two distinct providers. DeepSeek plus MiniMax satisfies it. A single-provider panel is written only after the operator explicitly confirms the reduced diversity during setup, and the setup report records that confirmation. The adversarial signal comes from model diversity, so treat the override as an exception, not a configuration style.

## Read-time normalization

Normalize configured descriptors before matching them to the matrix or choosing a route. If a provider-qualified Claude model starts with `claude-fable-` or `claude-opus-` and its remaining revision contains only digits and hyphens, replace that model component in memory with `fable` or `opus`. Preserve provider, effort, role, and lane order. Use only the normalized descriptor for native dispatch or runner argv. Never pass the versioned predecessor to Claude.

This read-time rule makes an older installed sheet use the latest family revision immediately without writing user files. Once per parent run, report that the persisted sheet is stale and that `/setup-pstack` will rewrite it after its normal probes and confirmation. Unknown versioned Claude models remain invalid. The external runner rejects a missed Fable or Opus version pin instead of silently executing it.

`fast` is part of Cursor's Grok selector, not a Grok Build CLI model or effort flag. The portable Grok route pins the current CLI model `grok-4.6`. The first-run Grok effort is `xhigh`.

## The parent owns the route

The top-level harness resolves the route once. A child receives an assigned provider, model, effort, access mode, prompt, working directory, and output path. A child never detects the harness, chooses a provider, or launches another model. Environment markers may corroborate the top-level harness before fan-out, but nested processes inherit parent markers and must not use them for routing.

| Parent | `claude:*` | `codex:*` | `grok:*` | `deepseek:*` | `minimax:*` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | native `Agent` | external runner | external runner | external runner | external runner |
| Codex | external runner | native `spawn_agent` | external runner | external runner | external runner |

Flex gateway descriptors are never native, even under a Claude Code parent: the gateway lane must run in its own process with injected endpoint, token, and isolated config dir, which the parent's native `Agent` primitive cannot provide.

`inherit-parent` and `auto` remain aliases. They use the parent's current model and effort through its native subagent primitive. In a panel they still consume one lane, but they reduce provider diversity; say so in the synthesis record.

## Native lanes

Native dispatch avoids a second CLI startup and its base context.

- Claude Code: match the descriptor's `(provider, model)` to one model-matrix row, then dispatch it through `pstack-<stem>-<effort>` using that row's Claude-native agent stem and the descriptor's effort. Those definitions select the rolling model alias, requested effort, and `background: true`. `pstack-fable-max` and `pstack-opus-xhigh` remain in that set. Pass the complete task, grounding paths, access mode, and unique output location in the `Agent` prompt. Retain the task handle and drain it only after fan-out.
- Codex: call `spawn_agent` with the descriptor's model and `reasoning_effort`, the complete task, grounding paths, access mode, and unique output location. Use an isolated worktree for a writer. Codex subagents already run concurrently.

Do not send a same-provider descriptor to the external runner. It rejects that call because the native route is cheaper and already available.

## External lanes

The launcher lives at `skills/poteto-mode/scripts/runner/pstack-runner` under the installed plugin. The parent writes the complete candidate prompt to a unique file, creates a unique output directory or worktree, and invokes the launcher directly. Do not put another agent in front of it.

```text
pstack-runner \
  --parent <claude|codex> \
  --provider <claude|codex|grok|deepseek|minimax> \
  --model <real CLI model> \
  --effort <low|medium|high|xhigh|max> \
  --mode <read-only|isolated-write> \
  --prompt <unique prompt file> \
  --cwd <repository or dedicated worktree> \
  --output <unique final-response file> \
  --receipt <unique receipt file> \
  [--timeout <seconds>]
```

Pass arguments as an argv array or quote every path. Never interpolate prompt text into a shell command. The launcher preflights the assigned CLI and authentication, invokes the model exactly once, disables recursive agents and ambient skill dispatch where the CLI supports it, restricts the built-in tool surface, and records the exact provider/model/effort flags. External lanes do not receive the parent's MCP surface. Keep MCP-dependent Why and Reflect roles on `inherit-parent` or `auto`. The launcher never falls back.

Gateway lanes (`deepseek`, `minimax`) run three checks before the model executes, all fail-closed. First, in-process: the lane's API key variable must be set, and the lane's isolated `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` must be free of OAuth credentials — a `.credentials.json` carrying a claude.ai login, or one that cannot be parsed, refuses the lane with an `unauthenticated` receipt before any subprocess runs, so a claude.ai credential can never be sent to a third-party endpoint. Second, the spawned preflight is `claude --version`, which proves the binary executes; `claude auth status` is deliberately not used because its behavior under token auth is undocumented. Third, the one-shot invocation is the real authentication and model test; an endpoint authentication error classifies as `unauthenticated` like any other lane.

Grok authentication preflight has one bounded retry. If the first `grok models` result would be classified as unauthenticated, the runner waits five seconds and tries the same preflight once more. A second failure is terminal. The delay and second attempt share the runner's absolute deadline and cancellation latch, and the receipt keeps evidence from both attempts. Model execution is never retried.

The parent tool sandbox still governs whether a subscribed child CLI can reach its credentials and network. Run setup's live probe from the actual parent profile. A blocked external CLI is a loud dropout, not a reason to elevate permissions or substitute a model silently.

The parent invocation must itself be resumable background work:

- Claude Code: call the launcher through a Bash tool invocation with `run_in_background: true` and retain its task ID. A foreground Bash tool call has an automatic ten-minute ceiling even when the runner's own timeout is longer. Shelling out with `&` and losing the task handle is not equivalent.
- Codex: run the launcher in a persistent exec session that returns a session ID, then wait or poll that handle. Do not hold one foreground tool call open for the model's full runtime.

Start the background process, continue launching the other lanes, then drain their handles. Native and external lanes belong in the same fan-out phase.

The runner and its preflight have no implicit timeout. Do not invent a duration from role, mode, or a convenient round number; real implementation lanes can run for 90 minutes or much longer. Pass `--timeout` only when the user, an external service deadline, or a measured task contract supplies a real bound. That value starts at wrapper entry, before module loading and argument parsing, and remains one absolute deadline across setup, preflight, model execution, and output capture. It is never a fresh allowance per child, and long waits are armed in runtime-safe chunks without shortening the supplied deadline. Otherwise supervise liveness through the retained background task/session handle and cancel manually only on evidence that the run is dead. Cancel through that retained handle so the runner receives SIGINT or SIGTERM, sends it to an active child when one remains, stops waiting on inherited output pipes, removes the empty output reservation, and writes a `cancelled` receipt. Preserve that receipt; a retry is a new attempt with new unique output and receipt paths. Unchanged running state is not a dropout, and Claude's ten-minute foreground ceiling is never a reason to terminate a healthy lane.

Read-only mode maps to Claude plan mode with project-only settings and an explicit tool list, Codex's read-only sandbox, and Grok plan mode plus its `read-only` sandbox and read-oriented tool list. Grok's built-in read-only profile deliberately keeps its own state and system temporary directories writable, so point a read-only Grok lane at the actual checkout rather than a worktree under `/tmp`, `/var/tmp`, or the host's temporary directory. `isolated-write` maps to Claude `acceptEdits` with project-only settings, Codex `workspace-write`, and Grok `acceptEdits` plus its `workspace` sandbox and write-capable tool list. Give every writer only a dedicated worktree or output directory. Never route a writer into the primary checkout.

Every concurrent external lane needs distinct prompt, output, and receipt paths. The launcher reserves output and receipt paths exclusively and refuses to overwrite them.

## Completion and dropouts

Success requires all of these:

1. Exit status `0`.
2. Receipt status `complete`.
3. Either `modelVerified: true` with `modelEvidence: "provider-report"`, or a Codex receipt with `reportedModel: null`, `modelVerified: false`, and `modelEvidence: "pinned-argv"`, or a gateway (`deepseek`/`minimax`) receipt with `modelVerified: false` and `modelEvidence: "pinned-argv"` when the endpoint does not echo the requested slug. For Claude's `fable` and `opus` aliases, the concrete provider report must belong to the requested family. Codex 0.149.0 accepts the exact `--model` argument but does not report the served model in its JSONL stream. Gateway reports match case-insensitively because third-party endpoints are inconsistent about slug casing.
4. A non-empty output file.

The receipt also carries elapsed time, token usage when the CLI exposes it, and cost when available. Keep it with the arena or review artifacts so parent-harness comparisons are evidence-based.

Any missing CLI, failed login, unavailable model, explicit timeout, cancellation, catchable post-reservation launcher failure, non-zero child exit, malformed result, or model mismatch is a receipt-bearing dropout. Record it and apply the calling skill's existing dropout policy. A `cancelled` receipt proves that the runner received the signal; its `signal` field is non-null only when the runner sent that signal to a still-active direct CLI child, and remains null when cancellation only stopped a post-exit pipe drain. The provider CLI owns any processes it starts beneath that direct child; the receipt does not claim a process-tree kill. Do not delete or overwrite the receipt. Never substitute the parent model, retry another provider, or reinterpret an external descriptor as a native model slug.

Start native and external lanes in the same fan-out phase, then wait for all of them before judging. A judge must not read candidate paths while their owners are still writing.
